An implementation of **Game of Life** in **Ruby**.

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life):

The **Game of Life** (**Juego de la vida** in spanish), also known simply as **Life**, is a
[cellular automaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton) devised by the British
mathematician [John Horton Conway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Horton_Conway) in 1970.
It is a [zero-player game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-player_game), meaning that its
evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with
the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves.
